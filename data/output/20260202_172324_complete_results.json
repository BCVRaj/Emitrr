      "History_of_Present_Illness": "Ms. Jones was involved in a car accident on September 1st, around 12:30 PM, while driving from Cheadle Hulme to Manchester. Her car was hit from behind, pushing it into the vehicle in front. She was wearing her seatbelt. Immediately after the impact, she experienced shock, hit her head on the steering wheel, and felt pain in her neck and back. She sought medical attention at Moss Bank Accident and Emergency, where she was diagnosed with a whiplash injury; no X-rays were performed. The first four weeks post-accident were characterized by severe neck and back pain, difficulty sleeping, and regular use of painkillers. Symptoms began improving after this period, and she underwent ten sessions of physiotherapy for stiffness and discomfort. Currently, she experiences occasional backaches, which are not constant and significantly less severe than initially. She denies any anxiety while driving, difficulty concentrating, or emotional issues related to the accident. The accident led to one week off work, but she has since returned to her usual routine with no significant impact on her daily life or hobbies."
